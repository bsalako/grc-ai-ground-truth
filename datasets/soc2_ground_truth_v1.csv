SOC 2,Security,CC6.1,SOC2-CC6-001,"Are privileged accounts protected with multi-factor authentication (MFA)?","Yes. MFA is enforced for all privileged accounts accessing production systems.","MFA enforced via centralized IdP; hardware or app-based authenticators; documented conditional access rules with no exclusions for privileged roles.","MFA is planned; MFA applies to some admins; MFA recommended but not enforced; password-only access.","IdP MFA configuration; IAM policy; access logs showing MFA challenges for privileged roles.","Evidence must demonstrate enforcement, not intent or policy language.",High,"Partial MFA coverage or undocumented exceptions typically result in audit findings."
SOC 2,Security,CC6.1,SOC2-CC6-002,"How are service accounts and non-human privileged accounts secured?","Service accounts are restricted, monitored, and protected using compensating controls where MFA is not technically feasible.","Use of short-lived credentials; workload identity or IAM roles; secrets rotation; scoped permissions; continuous monitoring.","Service accounts use long-lived static credentials; no monitoring; excessive permissions; undocumented access.","IAM role configuration; secrets management configuration; access logs; rotation policies.","Evidence must show restricted scope and active controls, not assumptions.","High","Auditors expect explicit acknowledgment that MFA may not apply to service accounts and require compensating controls."
