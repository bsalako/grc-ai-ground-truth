# GRC AI Ground Truth Dataset

Hello, this repository contains structured datasets, rating guides, and methodology for evaluating AI-generated outputs against real-world **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** standards.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to:
- Define a **ground truth dataset** for compliance questions
- Build reproducible truth-checking methods
- Evaluate AI responses against audit-ready expectations

It is useful for:
- AI evaluation projects
- Compliance automation research
